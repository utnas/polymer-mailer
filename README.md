Polymer Mailer
==============

Will be deployed on firebase [https://polymer-mailer.firebaseapp.com/](https://polymer-mailer.firebaseapp.com/ "")

This project is just a warm-up on my road to learn Polymer.js. A web component based framework.
The same application will be build with the most popular JavaScript frameworks: EmberJs, AngularJs and ReactJs.

Dependencies:
-   Grunt
-   Bower
-   Twitter Bootstrap: "v3.2.0"
-   NodeJs: "~v0.12" as web server
